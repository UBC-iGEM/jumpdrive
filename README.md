## Overview
Jumpdrive is a slim, minimally-featured library to statically serve a directory over HTTP. In addition, handling of one or more `GET` endpoints and a WebSocket (RFC 6455) connection is supported.

## Usage
Jumpdrive executes its event loop via the titular `jumpdrive!` macro, and provides various helper functions to assist endpoint handlers.
```rust
jumpdrive! {
    dir = "public/",
    ws = ["/ws", ws_handler],
    routes = {
        "/csv": csv_server
    },
    err = err_callback
}
```
